# Basic brainrender Workflow

In an anaconda terminal navigate to whatever directory your python file is in, then create an environment

```
(base) >conda create brainrenderenvironment
```

Activate your environment with:
```
(base) >conda activate brainrenderenvironment
```

Now you need to install brainrender with:

```
(brainrenderenvironment) >pip install brainrender
```

Now all you need to do is run your python code

```
(brainrenderenvironment) >python brainrendertest.py
```
