In an anaconda terminal navigate to whatever directory your python file is in, then create an environment

```
C\Users\whoever\directory>conda create brainrenderenvironment
```

Now you need to install brainrender with:

```
C\Users\whoever\directory>pip install brainrender
```

Now all you need to do is run your python code

```
C\Users\whoever\directory>python brainrendertest.py
```
