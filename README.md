# Basic brainrender Workflow

In an anaconda terminal navigate to whatever directory your python file is in, then create an environment

```
(base) C:\Users\whoever\directory>**conda create brainrenderenvironment**
```

Activate your environment with:
```
(base) C:\Users\whoever\directory>**conda activate brainrenderenvironment**
```

Now you need to install brainrender with:

```
(brainrenderenvironment) C:\Users\whoever\directory>**pip install brainrender**
```

Now all you need to do is run your python code

```
(brainrenderenvironment) C:\Users\whoever\directory>**python brainrendertest.py**
```
